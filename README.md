### Hi there 👋

My name is Paul Aimé, and I'm a tech enthusiast and privacy advocate based in France. 🇫🇷  
I write on [my blog](https://iampox.com/blog/) about technology and privacy, and I create repositories about the same stuff here.

I'm currently working as a freelance graphic designer, and looking for my next mission.  
On my free time, I'm trying to learn JavaScript and Python, but it's a work in progress. 👨‍💻

If you like what I do, you can support me on [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/paulaime).

If you need to reach me, you can easily do so on [Mastodon](https://piaille.fr/@paul).

Have a nice day! 🔆
